# About Me
Hi, I'm Lynn. I'm a novice engineer focusing on .NET development. In my free time, I enjoy reading technical blogs and participating in programming community meetups.

Whenever I have some spare time, I organize my notes into articles to enhance my memory. If you have any technical questions, feel free to discuss them with me.
